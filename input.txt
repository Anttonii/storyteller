My husband (M50) is absolutely dumbfounded that I (45F) am leaving him because he became broke.

My husband and I fell in love 25 years ago and married. I supported him and he was lucky to fall into a career where he failed upwards. I have a comfortable job so while it doesn’t pay as well, I can expect a reasonable pension when I retire.

He is a serial cheater. I found out when I was 30. I was devastated that he cheated once but I rationalized that it was a one time mistake. I later found out that he would cheat constantly and had in fact cheated throughout our marriage. I lost any sort of belief I had in love because I believed that he would be one man who would never cheat.

My prior boyfriend had cheated on me. My dad cheated on my mom. I grew up hearing that a man is only as loyal as his options. And my husband had a lot of options.

He also had a lot of cash to flash. Honestly I stayed for the money. If I was going to get cheated on, why not in a comfortable life? I didn’t have to do chores, I didn’t have to worry about money.

I am a relatively modest person in some ways so I wouldn’t spend money on a nice car or a luxurious house or expensive food. However I did invest in my face and body for both beauty and health.

My husband has a massive gambling problem and he lost his cushy job. He can’t manage to find another one that pays well.

He thought I would stay by his side and help him rebuild.

I told him that I wanted a divorce. There was no point in being married to him if he didn’t have money.

I retained a lawyer and served him divorce papers. My lawyer recommended I get out before my husband started draining retirement accounts

I have no desire to date again. I can survive on my own. I enjoy my job and it pays me enough for a modest, comfortable living.

He was dumbfounded and very hurt. AITAH?
